# CSCE478-Project



For instructions on how we use our code, we login to swan-ood.unl.edu and spin up a new JupyterLabs app instance (choose however long you want the server to run).

1) Create a new folder for this and/or clone the repository (while writing this, it's a private github repo and therefore gives issues on Swan server trying to clone. You only need to really download the csv files and then upload them into swan from your computer. You won't need the python files uploaded since you will just copy the code into a JupyterLab notebook.)
2) After making sure csv files are in your intended directory, create a new CSCE478 notebook.
3) Paste the source code for which model you want to use into the notebook file.
4) Run the code and it will give you statistics about the model and make graphs as well for you to analyze.
